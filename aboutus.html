            <h2>About Barangay Sapao</h2>
            <p>
              Barangay Sapao is a coastal community in the municipality of
              Guiuan, Eastern Samar, Philippines. It played a significant role
              during World War II as part of the expansive U.S. Naval Base in
              Guiuan, which served as a strategic point for Allied Forces in the
              Pacific. The barangay is home to the Parish of the Holy Cross, a
              Roman Catholic parish established as a quasi-parish in 1999 and
              formally canonically erected in 2004. The parish celebrates its
              feast day every May 7 in honor of the Holy Cross. Sapao is also
              known for its natural attractions, including Sapao Beach, with its
              white sands and diverse shells offering scenic views of the
              Pacific Ocean. The barangay hosts essential community facilities
              such as the Barangay Hall, Day Care Center, and Basketball Court.
              Additionally, Sapao is the location of a PAGASA weather station
              equipped with a Doppler radar system, contributing to regional
              weather monitoring and forecasting.

            <h2>Community Development</h2>
            <p>
              Barangay Sapao continues to thrive through the dedication and hard
              work of its local officials. According to the one barangay
              official, their responsibilities are wide-ranging, focusing on
              maintaining peace, implementing community development projects,
              and improving the quality of life for their residents. Their
              duties include enforcing rules and regulations and ensuring that
              the community adheres to policies designed to promote order and
              growth. One of the projects currently being implemented is the “I
              Love You Sapao” initiative, which aims to foster unity and pride
              within the barangay. However, the project is still ongoing due to
              the officials' busy schedules, as they are currently preparing for
              the much-anticipated annual fiesta. Fishing remains the primary
              source of livelihood for many residents, given the barangay's
              proximity to the sea. Understanding the needs of their
              constituents, the barangay officials actively support working
              individuals and low-income families. They do this by facilitating
              programs from the Department of Social Welfare and Development
              (DSWD), and by initiating projects that benefit the most
              vulnerable members of their community. The fiesta of Sta. Cruz is
              a major event in Barangay Sapao, celebrated with great enthusiasm.
              Festivities include a vesper night and a solemn mass held at the
              local church, often officiated by a bishop. These events not only
              reflect the community’s devotion but also strengthen their
              cultural heritage and social ties. Barangay Sapao is home to two
              sitios: San Roque and Dumrog. Each sitio has its own unique
              celebrations and traditions, adding to the rich and diverse
              culture of the barangay. Through the collective efforts of its
              officials and residents, Barangay Sapao stands as a testament to
              the strength of community and the power of local governance.

            <h2>About The Team</h2>
            <p>
              The 2nd year students of Eastern Samar State University of Guiuan
              aimed to help the Barangay of Sapao grow its tourism by making a
              website about the history and tourist spots in the said location.
              This project supports a shared goal of using technology to
              strengthen communities, promote tourism, and build local pride in
              the digital age.
