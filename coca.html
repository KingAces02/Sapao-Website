            <h1>Coca Beach Resort</h1>
            <p class="article-p1">
              Coca Beach is one of the hidden coastal treasures of Barangay
              Sapao in Guiuan, Eastern Samar. Tucked away from the bustling town
              proper, this beach offers a peaceful and almost untouched seaside
              experience that appeals to travelers seeking relaxation and
              natural beauty. It is not widely known outside the local
              community, which helps preserve its quiet charm and uncrowded
              shores. The journey to Coca Beach involves a walk through a
              simple, tree-lined trail that suddenly opens up to the vast and
              breathtaking view of the Pacific Ocean. Once there, visitors are
              welcomed by open-air cottages with nipa and bamboo architecture,
              offering a true taste of the laid-back Eastern Visayan lifestyle.
              These cottages are available for rent at budget-friendly rates,
              ranging from ₱500 to ₱1,000, depending on size and features,
              making the beach accessible to students, families, and local
              tourists alike.

              According to the granddaughter of the owner of the beach resort,
              the name of the beach was taken from her grandfather and
              grandmother’s name “Cornelio Sison” and “Caridad Sison” hence the
              name COCA taken from the first two letters of their name.
              According to her Coca was not actually a planned business since it
              started out to be a private property of their family before the
              pandemic on 2019 occurred, it was nothing but a simple place for
              them to get to when they wanted to hang-out, during the pandemic
              it was cleared off of its surroundings because they wanted to have
              a place where they can unwear their mask, a place where all their
              family can get to without the worry of taking off their mask.
              Later on their family decided to make it available to the public
              and make it a beach resort, it is now well known it the area for
              family outings, and other recreational activities.

              Although Coca Beach is not a war site or religious landmark, its
              peacefulness and simplicity reflect the lifestyle and values of
              the Guiuananons—resilience, hospitality, and harmony with nature.
              With its blend of scenic landscapes, cultural touchstones, and
              accessibility, Coca Beach serves not just as a local hangout, but
              as a meaningful destination for those who want to experience
              Samar's understated beauty and community warmth.
